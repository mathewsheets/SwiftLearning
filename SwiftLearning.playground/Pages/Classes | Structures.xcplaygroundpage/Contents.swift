 # Classes & Structures
 * callout(Session Overview): The Swift language features that we learned in the previous sessions dealt with simple data types. We learned about 'Int's, 'String's, 'Bool's that allowed us to store values with the correct data type. We can group a small number of data type values together as an atomic unit using tuples and we can store data type values in containers that will enabled us to collect data throughout our programs. Swift also provides us the ability to extend Swift itself by creating custom data types in the form of Classes and Structures. These custom data types in their simplest form are really composite data types, data types that contain other data types.

 */
import Foundation
/*:
 ## Creating
 Creating a class or a structure is done with the keywords `class` and `struct`.
 */
class President {
    
}

struct Term {
    
}
/*:
 Above we created a class `President` and a structure `Term`. Right now they don't store data or have behavior. Throughout this session we will build out what a `President` and `Term` can store the behavior it provides.
 */
/*:
 ## Types vs. Instances
 `President` and `Term` are types. There is only 1 in existence throughout your program. We can create many instances of a `President` or `Term`. Remember the simple data types such as `Int` and `String`? There is only 1 `Int` and 1 `String` data type in Swift, but we can create as many instances as `Int` or `String` that we like.
 */
let president = President()

let term = Term()
/*:
 Above we have created instances of type `President` and `Term` into constants. We create `President` and `Term` instance using an initializer `()`.
 */
/*:
 ## Value Types vs. Reference Types
 Value types are data types like `Int` and `String`, their values are copied when either assigned to constancts or variables or passed to functions. Reference types are data type like closures, you are assigning or passing a location pointing to a memory space. Structures are *value types*. Classes are *reference types*. The difference is very important.
 */
/*:
 ## Properties
 Properties enable you to store data within a class or structure. Properties are constants or variables tied to the class/structure (data type) or to an instance of the class/structure.
 */
class President1 {
    
    static var address = "" // stored type property
    
    let country = "United States of America" // stored instance constant property
    
    var name = "" // stored instance variable propery
}

struct Term1 {
    
    static let length = 4 // stored type property
    
    var start: Date? // stored instance variable propery
    
    var end: Date? // stored instance variable propery
}
/*:
 Above we created a class `President1` and structure `Term1`, each with a type property and instance properties of a constant and variables. Some properties are initialized and some are optional.
 */
/*:
 ### Instance Stored Properties
 `President1` and `Term1` both have instance stored properties. You can change instance stored properties through out your program for that particular instance.
 */
let president1 = President1()

president1.name = "George Washington"

var term1 = Term1()

term1.start = DateUtils.createDate(year: 1789, month: 4, day: 30)
term1.end = DateUtils.createDate(year: 1797, month: 3, day: 4)
/*:
 Above we assign the `president1.name`, `term1.start` and `term1.end` instance stored property.
 */
/*:
 ### Type Stored Properties
 Stored properties that only exist for the class/structure and *not* the instance of a class/structure are type stored properties. You create a type property with the keyword `static`.
 */
President1.address = "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500"

let presidentAddress = President1.address

let presidentialLength = Term1.length
/*:
 Above we assign the `President1.address` type store property. We are able to do this because it's a variable. The `Term.length` is a constant, therefore we can not assign a new value to it.
 */
//: > **Experiment**: Uncomment below to see what happens.
//president1.country = "South"

//Term1.length = 8

//let term2 = Term1();

//term2.start = nil
/*:
 #### Computed Properties
 Swift provides properties that look and act like stored properties, but they don't store anything; they derive values or accept values to be stored in a different way. These types of properties are called *computed properties*.
 */

 Above we created a `President3` class with stored properties of `birthDate` and `deathDate` and computed properties of `yearsAlive`, `diedHowLongAgo`, and `age`. Notice how the computed properteis act like proxies for the stored properties. Also notice how a computed property can be read-only as well as the shorhand version of the `set` for the `diedHowLongAgo` computed property.
 */
/*:
 ### Property Observers
 Swift provides the abiliy to observe changes to properties when values change. The `willSet` method is called just before the property value is set and the `didSet` is called just after the property value is set.

 Initializers on classes and structures are specials methods that initialize the class or structure.

/*:
 ## The `self` property and Custom Initializers
 Custom initializers are initializers created by you for the purpose of supplying values to a class/structure. You use the argument values of the initializer to set properties. If the argument names are the same as the property names, you can use the implicit `self` property to distinguish between the class/structure and the argument. One important note on custom initializers is that all non-optional stored properties must be initialized.
