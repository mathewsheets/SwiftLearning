 * callout(Exercise): Leveraging protocols and the delegation design pattern, your task is to build a simple bank teller system. The tellerâ€™s job responsibilities are to open, credit, debit savings and checking accounts. The teller is not sure what really happens when they perform their responsibilities, it just works.
