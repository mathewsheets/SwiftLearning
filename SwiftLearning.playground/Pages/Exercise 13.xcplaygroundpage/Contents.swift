 * callout(Exercise): Based on session [More Functions](More%20Functions) and Exercise 6, create a container that can store any type but provide methods to add/remove and query for instances of any type. Leverage the functions you created in Exercise 6, but create them as generic methods.
 
 **Constraints:**
 - Create a protocol for your container to conform to
 - Create a generic container to store any type
 - Add methods to add/remove instances
 - Add the follow methods for querying
     - `each` = Iterate over each element in the array
     - `all` = Returns true if all of the elements is not false
     - `any` = Returns true if at least one of the elements is not false
     - `contains` = Returns true if the element is present
     - `indexOf` = Returns the index at which element can be found
     - `filter` = Returns an array of all the elements that pass a truth test
     - `reject` = Returns the elements in the array without the elements that pass a truth test
     - `pluck` = Returns an array of a specific value from all the elements
