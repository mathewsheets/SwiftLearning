 * callout(Exercise): Create a Person API by creating a protocol and two classes conforming to the protocol with methods to create, retrieve, update and delete persons. One of the classes should *mock* the HTTP Client for the `GET` routes reading files for the JSON payload. The other class should leverage the above examples.
 
 **Constraints:**
 - Protocol with methods to create, retrieve, update and delete person instances
 - Class conforming to the protocol reading files for the JSON payloads
 - Class conforming to the protocol using URLRequest, URLResponse and URLSession
 - Each method body must use the appropriate example when implementing the HTTP Client class
 - Each method body must use what you learned in [JSON & Instances](JSON%20and%20Instances) to serialize/deserialize person instances
