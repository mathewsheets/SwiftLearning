 * callout(Exercise): You have a secret message to send. Write a playground that can encrypt strings with an alphabetical [caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher). This cipher can ignore numbers, symbols, and whitespace.
 
 **Example Output:**
 - Decrypted: Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power.
 - Encrypted: Arneyl nyy zra pna fgnaq nqirefvgl, ohg vs lbh jnag gb grfg n zna'f punenpgre, tvir uvz cbjre.
 
 
 
 **Constraints:**
 - The encrypted and decrypted text is case sensitive
 - Add a shift variable to indicate how many places to shift: *the example output has a shift value of 13*
