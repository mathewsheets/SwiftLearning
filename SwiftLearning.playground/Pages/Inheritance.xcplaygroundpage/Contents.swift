 # Inheritance
 * callout(Session Overview): When you think of inheritance, you probably think of material wealth that your parents or grandparents pass along to you when they die. Or possibly the genes you inherited from your parents and grandparents. Those aspects also ring true in object oriented programming. Inheritance is a technique in sharing and extending code within your programs and is an attribute of languages that support object oriented programming or *OOP*, such as Swift.

import Foundation
/*:
 ## What Is It?
 In the context of OOP, inheritance means that a class can inherit properties and methods from a superclass. The class that inherited the properties and methods is called the subclass. Swift only has the capability of single inheritance, meaning that a Swift class can only inherit from one superclass. Also, inheritance only applies to reference types, a.k.a classes.
 */
/*:
 ## The Base Class
 Classes that don’t inherit from any other class is called the base class. Unlike most OOP languages, Swift classes don’t inherit from a universal base class like *Object*. Classes you define without specifying a superclass automatically become base classes for you to subclass.

/*:
 Above we created a `Father` class. This is the base class for all subclasses of a `Father` class. We have also created an instance of the `Father` class providing the necessary arguments to initialize the `Father` class correctly.
 */
/*:
 ## The Subclass
 Having a class inherit from another class, or subclassing and superclass is done with the colon `:` directly after the class name and then the class you want to inherit after the colon. Once a class is defined as having subclassing another class, the subclass can immediately access the visible properties and methods (type and instance). The subclass can also have new properties and methods.

Notice when we created an instance of `Son` we are able to call the method `sayHello()` and access the computed property`description`.
 */
/*:
 ## Accessing superclass initializers, properties, methods and subscripts
 The subclass can access properties and methods from the superclass by using the keyword `super` in front of the property or method you want to access. The `super` keyword can also be used with initializers to delegate initialization to the superclass to initialize stored properties of the superclass.

/*:
 ## Overriding
 A subclass can change the implementation of a property and method (both type and instance) or a subscript that is inherited from a superclass by *overriding* the implementation inherited. This is done with the `override` keyword in front of the property, method or subscript you want to override.
 */
/*:
 ### Overriding Methods
 Overriding a method (either instance or type) is done by placing the `override` keyword before the function definition. If you override a method that is not defined in the superclass, you will receive a compiler error. When you override a method, it’s the implementation of the subclass that gets executed.

 Above we have created a new class `Grandson` inheriting from the `Son` class. We want the `sayHello` method of the `Grandson` class to provide a different implementation. We do this by overriding the `sayHello` method defined in the base class `Father`.
 */
/*:
 ### Overriding Properties
 Overriding a property (either instance or type) is similar to overriding a function; you also place the override keyword before the property definition. It doesn’t matter if the superclass’s property is a stored property or computed property. You can override a property in a subclass as long as the name and type are the same as in the superclass. You can override a property’s get and set methods as well as the property observers.

We also override the `age` property and provide property observers. Finally we override the `description` computed property printing out a different string than what is implemented in the `Mother` class.
 */
/*:
 ## Inheritance and Initialization
 When inheriting properties, especially stored properties, from a superclass, you not only need to initialize store properties within your subclass, you also need to initialize properties in the superclass. You can require an initializer to be present in a subclass with the `require` keyword preceding the custom initializer. The required custom initializer forces all subclasses to implement the superclass’s required custom initializer.

/*:
 ## Type Casting
 When working with class hierarchies that you have created in your program or provided to you from a framework, it’s often necessary to check if a class can become a specific type and perform type casting to make the object that your are working with become a valid type in the hierarchy.

 ### Checking the type
 You can check the type of an instance of a class by using the type check operator `is`. The `is` keyword checks if a class is of a certain subclass. The type check operator will return `true` if the class can be casted as the subclass and `false` if the class is not in the class hierarchy.

 Above we iterate over the `trainers` array and use the type check operator `is` to print the correct string for each `trainer`.

/*:
 ### Downcasting to get the type
 To actually cast a class as a subclass, downcasting, use the type cast operator `as` with either a question mark `?` or exclamation point `!`. Use `as?` if you are unsure if the class belongs in the class hierarchy, resulting in a `nil` if the class is not in the hierarchy. Conversely, use `as!` to force the type casting. If the class is not in the hierarchy, you will receive a runtime error.

 */
/*:
 ### Type Casting for Any and AnyObject
 Some frameworks that you will leverage within your program store an array of non specified types and indicate so with either using `typealias` of `AnyObject` or `Any`. `AnyObject` marks the type or collection of types as instances of classes. `Any` marks the type of collection of any thing, including tuples and function type.

 * callout(Checkpoint): At this point, you have learned how to leverage inheritance to share and reuse code and how to access the properties, methods and subscripts of a superclass. Overriding a superclass provide a subclass with having it’s custom implementation of a property, method or subscript. You can prevent a class, property, method or subscript from being overridden with he `final` keyword. `AnyObject` and `Any` are used to mark a type or collection of types as unspecified types while using the type check operator and type cast operator to convert the type type into a type you are interested in.
 
 **Keywords to remember:**
 - `super` = To access a superclass's properties, methods or subscripts
 - `override` = Custom implementation within the subclass of a superclass's properties, methods or subscripts
 - `required` = An initializer that all subclasses must implement
 - `final` = A class, property or method that cannot be overridden
 - `is` = Type check operator to check if an instance is of a specific type
 - `as` = Type cast operator that will downcast to the subclass type. Use `as?` is casting can fail; use `as!` if downcast will always succeed
 - `AnyObject` = Represents an instance of any class type
 - `Any` = Represents an instance of any type, including function types and tuples
