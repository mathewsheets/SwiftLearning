 # JSON & Instances
 * callout(Session Overview): Most applications are not “*solitaire*” type of applications where the application can operate in isolation and not interact with the outside world. Typical applications need to consider sending and receiving data and executing remote operations. There have been many technologies created enabling you to send data to another application or have one application execute an operation on another application. When developing mobile applications and learning the Swift programming language, the industry standard format of the data that is sent or received is a data format called **J**avascript **O**bject **N**otation, or **JSON**.

import Foundation
/*:
 ## What is JSON?
 **J**avascript **O**bject **N**otation, or **JSON**, is a simple, human readable and writable data-interchange format easily parsed and created by applications. You will typically hear JSON data called a **JSON Payload**. You send and receive JSON payloads from external sources or applications.
 
 ### *Serialization* or *Marshalling*
 The process of taking data within your application and converting it into a JSON payload is called *serialization* or *marshalling*. The JSON payload can be written to a file or sent over the internet using *HTTP*. Complex data types such as enumerations, structures and classes or simple data type such as `Int`s, `String`s, `Double`s, or `Bool`s are converted to a JSON payload.
 
 ### *Deserialization* or *Unmarshalling*
 The process of taking a JSON payload and converting it into data used within your application is called *deserialization* or *unmarshalling*. When a JSON payload is *deserialized* or *unmarshalled*, it is converted into complex data types such as enumerations, structures and classes or simple data type such as `Int`s, `String`s, `Double`s, or `Bool`s.
 ## The Syntax
 The following is a json payload of a dictionary with key and values of `String`. **Braces** indicate a dictionary with **comma** separating key & value pairs.
 ````
 {
    "id": "52206853-2787-458d-a85b-b37c2daf73d9",
    "name": "Mathew Sheets",
    "phone": "6141234567"
 }
 ````
 The following is a json payload of an array of dictionaries with key and values of `String`. **Brackets** indicate an array with **comma** separating array elements.
 ````
 [
     {
     "id": "52206853-2787-458d-a85b-b37c2daf73d9",
     "name": "Mathew Sheets",
     "phone": "6141234567",
     },
 ...
 ]
 ````
 ### Supported data types
 The following is a json payload with data types of `Int`, `String`, `Bool`, `[Int]`, `[String:String]` and data that is nil, or in JSON **null**, meaning no value.
 ````
 {
     "number": 123456,
     "string": "value can be a string",
     "boolean": true,
     "array": [1, 2, 3],
     "dictionary": {
         "key1": "value1",
         "key2": "value2"
     },
     "isnull": null
 }
 ````
 ## The Instances or the *Object Graph*
 The data within your application, or more specifically the instances of your enumerations, structures or classes will naturally evolve into a graph of data. The graph looks like a tree, or hierarchy of data with a parent / child relation ship between the types. This tree structure of data fits nicely into a JSON payload that can be sent or received to/from an external source. The following types will be used to create a JSON payload.
 
 `PersonSummary` is a type that represents a light view of a person but provides an `id` property for us to query with to receive another type with more properties. `PersonSummary` type would be used in a list comprised of properties for display, user action or retrieval of more data.
 */
class PersonSummary {
    
    var id: String?     // used to retrieve the PersonDetail
    var name: String?   // used for display
    var phone: String?  // used for user to push to call
}
/*:
 Both enumerations `NamePrefix` and `NameSuffix` represent in a static type-safe way the valid options for a person's name prefix and suffix. Notice that both enumerations are of type `String` giving us the rawValue of the literal case.
 */
enum NamePrefix: String {
    case Mr
    case Ms
    case Mrs

class Name {
    
    var first: String?
    var middle: String?
    var last: String?
    var prefix: NamePrefix?
    var suffix: NameSuffix?
}
/*:
 `Coordinate` represents a geo coordinate that can be leveraged on a map. It is acceptable that `Coordinate` is a structure because inheritance is not valid and we don't want `latitude` to be changed without `longitude` being reset.
 */
struct Coordinate {
    
    var latitude: Double?
    var longitude: Double?
}
/*:

 ## Enter JSONSerialization
 Practically all modern programing languages provide the mechanism to parse the contents of a JSON payload and/or take an object graph and create a JSON Payload. The Foundation Framework provides [JSONSerialization](https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/jsonserialization) for us to deserialized a JSON payload and serialize an object graph.
 
 First, we need to get the JSON payload loaded as a `String`. `summaryPayload` is a `String` that has a value of the contents from the file *persons.json* in the Resources directory. `detailPayload` is a `String` that has a value of the contents from the file *person.json*, also in the Resources directory.

All other types within the `Array` or `Dictionary` need to be an instance of String, Number, Array, Dictionary, or nil. `Dictionary` key must be `String`s.
