 ## Convenient Initializing
 Initializers are used to initialize your class/structure. The special `init` method is used as the initializer and should be defined with parameters that will initialize your stored properties. Swift provides a way to declare another type of initializer that could be more *convenient*. These `convenience` initializers must *delegate* to another `convenience` initializer or to a custom initializer.
 */
class President {
    
    var firstName: String
    var lastName: String
    var party: String
    var age: Int
    
    init(firstName: String, lastName: String, party: String, age: Int) {
        
        self.firstName = firstName
        self.lastName = lastName
        self.party = party

    }
    
    convenience init() {
        
        self.init(firstName: "", lastName: "", party: "", age: 0) // delegate to init
//        self.init(firstName: "", lastName: "") // delegate to another convenience init
    }
}

var none = President()
var abe = President(firstName: "Abraham", lastName: "Lincoln")
/*:
 Above we created a `class` President that has 1 initializer defined to initialize all the stored properties and 2 `convenience` initializers to give the option to create an instance of a President with just first and last names or with no values.
 */
/*:
 ## Failable Initializers
 When implementing custom initializers, it may be appropriate to fail the initialization. You can indicate that an initializer can fail with a `init?` initializer. Then within the initializer, you return `nil` and the result of the stored instance will be `nil`.
 */
class PresidentFailable {
    
    var age: Int
    
    init?(age: String) {

/*:
 Above we created a `PresidentFailable` class that has a failable initializer. We create an instance of `PresidentFailable` and by leveraging `if let` optional binding, and print a string of the presidentâ€™s age.
 */
/*:
 ## Optional Chaining
 You will create programs that have properties that have not been initialized. This means that you need to check if the property does have a value and then access the properties or call methods on that property. Optional chaining provides you the ability to access or call methods of a property contained in a class/structure without having to check for `nil`.
 */
struct Term {

 Above we have defined a structure `Term` and class `President1`. `President1` has an optional property `term` of type `Term`.

 ### When to use it
 Below we have the typical way in which we would check to see if we can get the date range of President Kennedy's term, by checking if `term` in not `nil`.
 */
let kennedy = President1(firstName: "John", lastName: "Kennedy")
if kennedy.term != nil {
    
    let range = kennedy.term!.dateRange()
    print("President Kennedy's term was \(range)")
}
/*:
 ### Used with Properties
 Optional chaining lets us access a potential `nil` property, and access properties *potentially* down a chain of properties.
 */
if let termStart = kennedy.term?.start, let termEnd = kennedy.term?.end {  // combining option binding in one `if`
    
    print("President Kennedy's term was \(termStart) - \(termEnd)")
}
/*:
 Above we leverage optional chaining, by using the question mark symbol directly after the property that could be `nil`, to access properties of that instance. We only print the date range if both `termStart` and `termEnd` are not `nil`.
 */
/*:
 ### Used with Methods
 We can also use optional chaining to call methods on a potentially `nil` property.
 */
if let termRange = kennedy.term?.dateRange() {
    
    print("President Kennedy's term was \(termRange)")
}
/*:
 Above we call the `dateRange()` method on an instance of the property `term` (an instance of class `Term`). If `term` is `nil`, the `dateRange()` method is never called and with the rules of option binding, the print statement is not executed.
 */
/*:
 ## `mutating` value types within instance methods
 Properties within value types in Swift (Enumerations & Structures) cannot be modified from within instance methods. You can change this behavior by placing the `mutating` keyword in front of the method name indicating that the method will mutate (change property values) the current instance.
 */

 */

 ## `mutating` your`self` in value types within instance methods
 `mutating` instance methods can even change what `self` refers to.

/*:
 ## Lazy Stored Properties
 Classes and structures are very similar to other data types. Therefore you can have properties that are of a class or structure type. There are times when it makes sense to initialize a class or structure whenever you access the property and not durning the initialization of the container class. We can do this lazy initializing with the `lazy` keyword.

We provide both the `get` and `set` subscript methods to access and mutate the `presidentsByCentury` property.
 */
/*:
 ## `strong`, `weak`, `unowned`, oh my!
 Swift provides three types of reference types. We have already worked with the `strong` reference type; it's the default reference type when assigning an instance of a reference type to a constant/variable. The other two `weak` and `unowned` are used to prevent *strong reference cycles* within your instance.

Without `weak` and `unowned`, the `deinit`s would never be called therefore creating a memory leak.
 */
/*:
 ## Identity Operators for Reference Types
 Identity operators are used to determine if two instances of the same class refer to the same location in memory; they are in fact the same instance. Identity operators for reference types are `===` three equal symbols or `!==` exclamation point and two equal symbols. This is not to be confussed with equatable operators `==` and `!=`, explained in [Protocols](Protocols), which typically compare the actual property values in each instance.

 Above we have two instances of the `President` class, both with the same first and last name. We assign the first `President` instance to another constant and compare if they are the exact same instance. The second instance is compared to the first to prove that they are not the same instance.
 */
/*:
 ## Control access with `public`, `internal`, `private`
 Swift provides three ways to control what is visible to other classes. The `public` keyword marks the class/member visible outside the module. The `internal` keyword marks the class/member visible only to inside the module. The `private` keyword marks the class/member visible to only the class itself. The default access is `internal`. You need to explicitly set a class/member to `public` for the class/member to be visible outside the module. Access control can be applied to properties, function, custom types and their properties and methods.

 * callout(Checkpoint): At this point, we learned about other features that classes/structures support such as lazy initialization of properties and subscripts to interact with classes/structures in a collection type way. We also learned about how you can change property values in value types within the instance as well as testing if two instances are identical. Finally we learned how to avoid memory leaks by using the correct reference type and how to leverage the access controls for properties, functions, classes and class members.
 
 **Keywords to remember:**
 - `convenience` = define an initializer that delegates the initialization to other initializers
 - `lazy` = define a stored property to be initialized when the property is first accessed
 - `subscript` = provide the ability to access/mutate a class/structure with subscripts as in `[5]`
 - `mutating` = allowing a value type instance method to change properties within the instance
 - `weak` = defining a optional stored property as storing a weak reference to avoid *strong reference cycles*
 - `unowned` = defining a non optional stored property as storing an unowned reference to avoid *strong reference cycles*
 - `public` = marks the class/member visible outside the module
 - `internal` = marks the class/member visible only to inside a module
 - `private` = marks the class/member visible to only the class
