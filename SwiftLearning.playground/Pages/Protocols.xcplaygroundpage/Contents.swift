 # Protocols
 * callout(Session Overview): In the context of the English language, a protocol is a set of rules that explain the conduct and procedures to be followed. You can also think of it as a contract between two parties and consequences if the contract is broken. In the context of typed programming languages, a protocol defines what must be implemented by a data type, with a compiler responding with errors if you don’t follow the protocol.

 */
import Foundation
/*:
 ## What Are They and Why Use Them?
 Swift protocols are essentially types without the implementation of properties or methods. They create a contract with a conforming type. The conforming type must implement the properties and methods defined in the protocol.
 
 As we have learned in earlier sessions, types can contain other types, as well as contain a collection of types. When applying that to protocols, you as the developer are unaware of the implementation, you only care that a property or method exists for you to access or call. This single attribute of protocols, not being aware of the implementation, gives you the ability to change the implementation or have multiple implementations of a protocol. This provides you with low coupling between two data types and a pluggable application architecture.
 */
/*:
 ## Conforming To
 In earlier sessions, we have already encountered protocols. Most of the data types we have worked with such as `Int`, `String` and `Bool` all **conform** to one of the following three protocols, `Equatable`, `Comparable`, and `Hashable`. We have also seen the `Error` protocol when creating a enumeration that can be used in a throwing function. Conforming to a protocol implies that the data type provides the implementation of the properties or methods defined in the protocol. You indicate conforming to a protocol by placing the protocol after a colon `:`, similar to how a class is inheriting from a superclass. If a class is inheriting and conforming, place the inheriting class first then the protocols separated by a comma. Protocols can also inherit from one another, similar to classes, but protocols can inherit from multiple protocols unlike classes.
 */
/*:
 ### The `Equatable` Protocol
 By conforming to the `Equatable` protocol, you are implying that your data type will implement `public func ==(lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -> Bool` and that instances of that type can be compared for value equality using operators `==` and `!=`.
 */

    var name: String

    init(name: String, age: Int) {
        
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    }

    // it's an operator, the implementation must be defined with static
    
    static func ==(lhs: Father, rhs: Father) -> Bool {
        
        return lhs.name == rhs.name && lhs.age == rhs.age
    }

 Above we created a `Father` class conforming to the `Equatable` protocol. The `Equatable` protocol requires us to implement `public func ==(lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -> Bool`, which we have with `func ==(lhs: Father, rhs: Father) -> Bool {...}`. Next we created three instances of `Father`, two of which are actually equals according to our implementation of `public func ==(lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -> Bool`. Also notice the use of the *identity Operator* `===`.
 */
/*:
 ### The `Comparable` Protocol
 By conforming to the `Comparable` protocol, you are implying that your data type will implement:
 - `public func <(lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -> Bool`
 - `public func <=(lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -> Bool`
 - `public func >=(lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -> Bool`
 - `public func >(lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -> Bool`

/*:
 Above we created a protocol with no properties or methods, simply as an example of how to create a protocol. The `Crawler` conforms to the `Crawlable` protocol, and in this case, nothing has to be implemented.
 */
/*:
 ## Protocols & Properties
 Protocols can define both type and instance properties. The conforming data type property could be either a stored or computed property, as long as the name and type are correct. When defining a property in a protocol, you need to specify what property methods need to be implemented with the `get` and/or `set` property methods.

 ## Protocols as Types
 With protocols and classes, the properties and methods defined in the protocol and the properties and methods implemented in the conforming class appear to be one in the same. Remember, protocols don’t provide the implementation, but classes do. You cannot create an instance of just a protocol, you must create an instance of a concrete data type that conforms to a protocol. This enables you do store, return, and pass as arguments to functions, data types confirming to a protocol with just the protocol name.

 ## Delegating the work with Protocols
 In the world of iOS development, the delegation design pattern is leveraged all through out the SDK. The delegation design pattern enables concrete classes to delegate work to other data types that conform to a protocol. The protocol is responsible to define what work that needs to be executed and conforming data types implement the work. The concrete data type that does the delegation does not need to know the underlining implementation of the protocol.
 ### The Protocols
 Protocols are what make the delegation design pattern powerful. We don't want our concrete classes coupled to a another concrete class.
